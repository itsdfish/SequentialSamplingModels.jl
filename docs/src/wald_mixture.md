# Wald Mixture Model

The Wald mixture model is a sequential sampling model for single choice decisions. It extends the Wald model by allowing the drift rate to vary randomly across trials. 

# Example
In this example, we will demonstrate how to use the Wald mixture model in a generic single choice decision task. 
```@setup wald_mixture
using SequentialSamplingModels
using SSMPlots 
using Random
```

## Load Packages
The first step is to load the required packages.

```@example wald_mixture_mixture
using SequentialSamplingModels
using SSMPlots 
using Random

Random.seed!(8741)
```
## Create Model Object
In the code below, we will define parameters for the LBA and create a model object to store the parameter values. 

### Drift Rate

The parameter $\nu$ represents the evidence accumulation rate.

```@example wald_mixture
ν = 3.0
```

### Drift Rate

The parameter $\nu$ represents the evidence accumulation rate.

```@example wald_mixture
ν = 3.0
```

### Drift Rate Variability

The parameter $\sigma$ represents the standard deviation of the evidence accumulation rate across trials.

```@example wald_mixture
σ = 0.20
```

### Threshold

The parameter $\alpha$ the amount of evidence required to make a decision.

```@example wald_mixture 
α = 0.50
```
### Non-Decision Time
Non-decision time is an additive constant representing encoding and motor response time. 
```@example wald_mixture 
τ = 0.130
```
### Wald Constructor 

Now that values have been asigned to the parameters, we will pass them to `WaldMixture` to generate the model object.

```@example wald_mixture 
dist = WaldMixture(ν, σ, α, τ)
```
## Simulate Model

Now that the model is defined, we will generate $10,000$ choices and reaction times using `rand`. 

 ```@example wald_mixture 
rts = rand(dist, 1000)
```

## Compute  PDF
Similarly, the log PDF for each observation can be computed as follows:

 ```@example wald_mixture 
pdf.(dist, rts)
```

## Compute Log PDF
Similarly, the log PDF for each observation can be computed as follows:

 ```@example wald_mixture 
logpdf.(dist, rts)
```

## Plot Simulation
The code below overlays the PDF on reaction time histogram.
 ```@example wald_mixture 
histogram(dist)
plot!(dist; t_range=range(.130, 1, length=100))
```
